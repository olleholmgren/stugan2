# The Wilderness
A mix of weel-being consultation and an adventure game!

Do yourself a favor and take some time dedicated just to you.

# Purpose
The aim for for this game is simply to just give the player a minute by themselves. A mix of mindfulness and navigate-adventure is the core idea for this project.

# Gameplay
The player is greeted when run.py is launched. I the beginning the computer will ask the player about the mood for this day and if the player chooses to continue talk to the computer, there will be more questions - the game works like a computed therapist.


# Wireframe
This is my first time I actually used the wireframe software. It helped me a lot when I got stuck with coding. I only feel good if I am inside a work flow. When I am stuck with coding then I just step over to work on the wireframe and the idea of the game.

# Game map
The game map is simple. Just a grid structure with boxes that each have a corrensponding number. I found myself numbering in an order that I wanted, then it hit me - the boxes are just like the Fibonacci Numbers
