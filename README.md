# The Wilderness
A mix of weel-being consultation and an adventure game!

Do yourself a favor and take some time dedicated just for your own well-being.

# Purpose
The aim for for this game is simply to just give the player a minute by themselves. A mix of mindfulness and navigate-adventure is the core idea for this project.

# Wireframe
This is my first time I actually used the wireframe software. I have use Balsamiq for this project wireframe. It helped me a lot when I got stuck with coding. I only feel good if I am inside a work flow. When I am stuck with coding then I just step over to work on the wireframe and the idea of the game.

# Gameplay
The player is greeted when run.py is launched. In the beginning the computer will ask the player about the mood for this day and if the player chooses to continue talk to the computer, there will be more questions - the game works like a computed therapist. 
If the player then wants to play the adventure game, the game will start, or if not, the player will be waved goodbye to and be told to come back when feeling better.

# Game map
The game map is simple. Just a grid structure with boxes that each have a corrensponding number. I found myself numbering in an order that I wanted, then it hit me - the boxes are structured just like the Fibonacci Numbers. This coincidence got me scared for a while but I decided to move on.

# Flow chart
In order to organise my ideas and brainwork, I decided to make a flow-chart with Balsamiq
